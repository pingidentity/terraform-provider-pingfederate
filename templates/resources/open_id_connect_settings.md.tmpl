# {{.Name}} ({{.Type}})

{{ .Description | trimspace }}

!> The `pingfederate_open_id_connect_settings` resource has been renamed and will be removed in a future release. Use the `pingfederate_openid_connect_settings` resource instead.

## Example Usage

{{ tffile (printf "%s%s%s" "examples/resources/" .Name "/resource.tf") }}

{{ .SchemaMarkdown | trimspace }}

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

~> This resource is singleton, so the value of "id" doesn't matter - it is just a placeholder, and required by Terraform

{{ codefile "shell" (printf "%s%s%s" "examples/resources/" .Name "/import.sh") }}
