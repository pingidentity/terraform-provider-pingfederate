# PingFederate Provider

The PingFederate provider manages the configuration of a PingFederate server.

# Disclaimer - Provider in Development
The PingFederate Terraform provider is under active development. As such, consumers must have flexibility for breaking changes until the `1.0.0` release. When using the PingFederate Terraform Provider within an automated pipeline prior to `1.0.0`, it is recommended to pin the provider version similar to `version = "~> 0.5.0"` to avoid experiencing an unexpected pipeline failure as the result of a provider change. Enhancements, bug fixes, notes and breaking changes can be found on the [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md). If issues are found, please raise a [github issue](https://github.com/pingidentity/terraform-provider-pingfederate/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&projects=&template=bug_report.md&title=) on this project.

## PingFederate Version Support

The PingFederate provider supports versions `11.2` through `12.0` of PingFederate.

## Documentation
Detailed documentation on PingFederate can be found in the [online docs](https://docs.pingidentity.com/r/en-us/pingfederate-112/pf_pingfederate_landing_page)
### Example Usage of PingFederate Provider
{{ tffile "examples/simple-examples/main.tf" }}

### Custom User Agent information

The PingFederate provider allows custom information to be appended to the default user agent string (that includes Terraform provider version information) by setting the `PINGFEDERATE_TF_APPEND_USER_AGENT` environment variable.  This can be useful when troubleshooting issues with Ping Identity Support, or adding context to HTTP requests.

```shell
export PINGFEDERATE_TF_APPEND_USER_AGENT="Jenkins/2.426.2"
```
