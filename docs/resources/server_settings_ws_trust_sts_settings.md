# pingfederate_server_settings_ws_trust_sts_settings (Resource)

Resource to manage the WS-Trust STS settings.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "pingfederate_server_settings_ws_trust_sts_settings_issuer_certificate" "issuerCert" {
  file_data = filebase64("path/to/my/issuercert.pem")
}

resource "pingfederate_server_settings_ws_trust_sts_settings" "wsTrustStstSettings" {
  basic_authn_enabled       = true
  client_cert_authn_enabled = true
  restrict_by_subject_dn    = true
  restrict_by_issuer_cert   = true
  subject_dns = [
    "cn=my-restricted-issuer1",
    "cn=my-restricted-issuer2",
  ]
  users = [
    {
      username = "basic_auth_user_1"
      password = var.basic_auth_user_1_password
    },
    {
      username = "basic_auth_user_2"
      password = var.basic_auth_user_2_password
    },
  ]
  issuer_certs = [
    {
      id = pingfederate_server_settings_ws_trust_sts_settings_issuer_certificate.issuerCert.id
    }
  ]
}

- `basic_authn_enabled` (Boolean) Require the use of HTTP Basic Authentication to access WS-Trust STS endpoints. Requires users be populated. Default value is `false`.
- `client_cert_authn_enabled` (Boolean) Require the use of Client Cert Authentication to access WS-Trust STS endpoints. Requires either `restrict_by_subject_dn` and/or `restrict_by_issuer_cert` be `true`. Default value is `false`.
- `issuer_certs` (Attributes Set) List of certificate Issuers that are used to validate certificates for access to the WS-Trust STS endpoints. Required if `restrict_by_issuer_cert` is `true`. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--issuer_certs))
- `restrict_by_issuer_cert` (Boolean) Restrict Access by Issuer Certificate. Ignored if `client_cert_authn_enabled` is `false`. Default value is `false`.
- `restrict_by_subject_dn` (Boolean) Restrict Access by Subject DN. Ignored if `client_cert_authn_enabled` is `false`. Default value is `false`.
- `subject_dns` (Set of String) List of Subject DNs for certificates that are allowed to authenticate to WS-Trust STS endpoints. Required if `restrict_by_subject_dn` is `true`.
- `users` (Attributes Set) List of users authorized to access WS-Trust STS endpoints when `basic_auth_enabled` is `true`. At least one users entry is required if `basic_auth_enabled` is `true`. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--users))

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

~> This resource is singleton, so the value of "id" doesn't matter - it is just a placeholder, and required by Terraform

```shell
terraform import pingfederate_server_settings_ws_trust_sts_settings.wsTrustStstSettings id
```
