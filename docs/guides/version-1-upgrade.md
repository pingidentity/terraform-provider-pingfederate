# PingFederate Terraform Provider Version 1 Upgrade Guide (from version 0)

Version `1.0` of the PingFederate Terraform provider is a major release that introduces breaking changes to existing HCL. This guide describes the changes that are required to upgrade `v0.*` PingFederate Terraform provider releases to `v1.*`.

## Why have schemas changed?

As part of ensuring the ongoing maintainability of the Terraform provider integration and to solve functional issues, some resource schemas have changed going to version `1` from version `0`.

The schemas may have changed in the following ways in this release:

* Removal of previously deprecated fields
* Removal of previously deprecated resources/data sources
* Renaming of fields for consistency

The following sections detail the rationale for the above changes, and whether the changes are routine for a major version upgrade or one off changes that aren't expected in future major version changes.

### Removal of previously deprecated fields

Removal of deprecated fields are expected on each major release going forward.  Ping maintains a deprecation and release strategy according to [Terraform provider creation best practices](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/best-practices/versioning) and support of PingFederate product versions aligns with the [Ping Identity End of Life Policy](https://www.pingidentity.com/en/legal/end-of-life-policy.html).

### Removal of previously deprecated resources/data sources

Removal of deprecated resources / data sources are expected on each major release going forward.  Ping maintains a deprecation and release strategy according to [Terraform provider creation best practices](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/best-practices/versioning) and support of PingFederate product versions aligns with the [Ping Identity End of Life Policy](https://www.pingidentity.com/en/legal/end-of-life-policy.html).

### Renaming of fields for consistency

Renaming of fields is not expected for future releases. Any renaming will occur only in major releases.  Ping maintains a release strategy according to [Terraform provider creation best practices](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/best-practices/versioning)

### Removal of support for previous PingFederate versions

The support of PingFederate product versions aligns with the [Ping Identity End of Life Policy](https://www.pingidentity.com/en/legal/end-of-life-policy.html).  In this major release, supported PingFederate versions remain unchanged, versions `11.2` through `12.1` of PingFederate (supported in the `v0.*` release) are still supported.

## Provider Configuration Changes

### Major Version Change

Customers can keep operating existing `v0.*` releases until ready to upgrade to `v1.*`.  Remaining on the latest `v0.*` release can be achieved using the following syntax:

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    pingfederate = {
      source  = "pingidentity/pingfederate"
      version = "~> 0.16"
    }
  }
}

provider "pingfederate" {
  username                            = "administrator"
  password                            = "2FederateM0re"
  https_host                          = "https://localhost:9999"
  admin_api_path                      = "/pf-admin-api/v1"
  insecure_trust_all_tls              = true
  x_bypass_external_validation_header = true
  product_version                     = "12.1"
}
```

It is highly recommended to go through the guide and make updates to each impacted resource before changing the version, as there are backward-incompatible changes.  Once ready to upgrade, the version can be incremented as follows:

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    pingfederate = {
      source  = "pingidentity/pingfederate"
      version = "~> 1.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "pingfederate" {
  username                            = "administrator"
  password                            = "2FederateM0re"
  https_host                          = "https://localhost:9999"
  admin_api_path                      = "/pf-admin-api/v1"
  insecure_trust_all_tls              = true
  x_bypass_external_validation_header = true
  product_version                     = "12.1"
}
```

Ping recommends using [Provider version control](https://terraform.pingidentity.com/best-practices/#use-provider-version-control), detailed in the [Terraform best practices guide](https://terraform.pingidentity.com/best-practices/).

## Resource: pingfederate_authentication_api_settings

### `id` computed attribute removed

The unnecessary `id` computed attribute has previously been deprecated and has now been removed.

## Resource: pingfederate_authentication_policies_settings

### `id` computed attribute removed

The unnecessary `id` computed attribute has previously been deprecated and has now been removed.

## Resource: pingfederate_extended_properties

### `id` computed attribute removed

The unnecessary `id` computed attribute has previously been deprecated and has now been removed.

## Resource: pingfederate_idp_adapter

### `attribute_contract` has been made a required field

The `attribute_contract` field was previously optional but has now been made a required field in the resource.  This is due to a Terraform limitation when calculating drift and may return back to being optional in the future.  Where an attribute contract is not needed, `attribute_contract` may be defined according to the following example:

```terraform
resource "pingfederate_idp_adapter" "my_idp_adapter" {
  # ... other configuration parameters

  attribute_contract = {}
}
```

## Resource: pingfederate_idp_default_urls

This resource has been previously deprecated and has now been removed. Use the `pingfederate_default_urls` resource going forward.

## Resource: pingfederate_idp_sp_connection

### certificate `x509file` field has been renamed to `x509_file`

The `x509file` field found at `credentials.certs.x509file` and `credentials.inbound_back_channel_auth.certs.x509file` has been renamed to `x509_file` for consistency with the `pingfederate_sp_idp_connection` resource.

Previous configuration example:
```terraform
resource "pingfederate_idp_sp_connection" "example" {
  # ... other configuration parameters
  credentials = {
    certs = [
      {
        x509file = {
          id        = "mycertid"
          file_data = filebase64("mycert.pem")
        }
      }
    ]
    inbound_back_channel_auth = {
      certs = [
        {
          x509file = {
            id        = "myothercertid"
            file_data = filebase64("myothercert.pem")
          }
        }
      ]
    }
    # ... other configuration parameters
  }
}
```

New configuration example:
```terraform
resource "pingfederate_idp_sp_connection" "example" {
  # ... other configuration parameters
  credentials = {
    certs = [
      {
        x509_file = {
          id        = "mycertid"
          file_data = filebase64("mycert.pem")
        }
      }
    ]
    inbound_back_channel_auth = {
      certs = [
        {
          x509_file = {
            id        = "myothercertid"
            file_data = filebase64("myothercert.pem")
          }
        }
      ]
    }
    # ... other configuration parameters
  }
}
```
